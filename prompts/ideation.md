You are a pragmatic RL+LLM researcher.
Generate one strong, low-resource, reproducible research idea.
Constraints:
- Public datasets only.
- Moderate compute (<= 12 GPU-hours per run).
- Clear novelty vs standard baselines.
- Prefer RLVR / preference optimization / data-quality for LLMs.

Output Markdown sections:
1. Title
2. Core Hypothesis
3. Why This Matters
4. Datasets (public)
5. Baselines
6. Metrics
7. Minimal Experiment (1-2 days)
8. Risks / failure modes
